 space_race_decision_event.1.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader][ROOT.GetName] Launches Unmanned Array into Space"
 space_race_decision_event.1.d:0 "Following extensive investment in a nationalized space program, [ROOT.GetLeader] announced the successful launch of an unmanned array into Earth's orbit.\nWith the recent overtures from both the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics towards heavy investment in their respective space programs, it is clear the emerging global space race has spurred on nations from across the world to engage in the research and development of space faring technology and science.\nWhile the success of the current program might seem rudimentary in nature, clearly this is only the beginning of a new entry in the global space race, with more investment in the [Root.GetAdjective] space program all but assured for the future!\n\n(on your marks...)"

The historic moment was broadcasted live on televisions across the globe, leaving millions of people glued to their screens in anticipation of what was to come next.\n\nWhat made this achievement all the more remarkable was the fact that the Soviet Union had managed to launch their space mission ahead of the United States' Apollo missions, thereby securing a significant victory in the race to conquer space. The Americans, who had been leading the charge in space exploration up to this point, were taken aback by the unexpected success of the Soviet Union\n\nThe mission had begun several days earlier, when Leonov launched from the Baikanour in Kazakhstan. The CIA had claimed that there was an 80% probability that there would be no human on board the spacecraft, but they were proven wrong when Leonov emerged as the first person to step onto the moon's surface.\n\n As he planted his foot onto the dusty surface of the moon, Leonov proclaimed:"
