 NATO_issue_10_desc:0 "Reports from Greece indicate communists are nearing victory in their Civil War. A communist victory puts the people of Greece under Soviet tyranny and communist repression. Strategically the loss of Greece would give the communists a dominant position in the Mediterranean. NATO commanders have proposed an operation called Aegean Shield. It will see NATO forces facilitate the evacuation of the Greek government and military to its islands, including, perhaps the transfer of Cyprus to Greece."

 NATO_issue_11:0 "Intervention in the Albanian Civil War"
 NATO_issue_11_desc:0 "Reports from Albania indicate that the Free Albania National Committee has launched a revolt in the north of the country against the Hoxha regime. A communist crackdown would subject the Albanian people to further oppression under Soviet-aligned dictatorship. Strategically, the fall of northern Albania would solidify communist control in the Balkans. NATO commanders have proposed an operation codenamed Balkan Shield, which would see NATO forces support the evacuation of anti-communist forces and the Albanian government-in-exile to secure keys locations."

 NATO_INTERVENTION.10.d:0 "Despite our valiant efforts, the communists continue to advance. It is likely that we may face the end of a free Greece. However, the NATO military alliance has approached us, offering a lifeline. They wish to intervene as a peacekeeping force and facilitate the evacuation of our government and military to the islands of the Aegean and Crete. The United Kingdom will even consider ceding Cyprus to further our legitimacy. From these islands we can rebuild our forces and lay the groundwork for the future liberation of Greece. However, there are some in the government and military who urge us to reject this proposal, as this could turn us into a NATO puppet."
 NATO_INTERVENTION.11.d:0 "NATO officials were stunned to receive news that the Greek government would not offer its support or endorsement of Operation Aegean Shield. Apparently many in the Greek government and military feel the establishment of a government on the Greek islands would simply prolong the conflict unnecessarily and compromise Greek sovereignty. There is also a feeling that a resistance movement or an effort to compromise with the communists can only succeed if Greek leaders remain on mainland Greece. Without support of the Greek government, Operation Aegean Shield cannot be activated."
 NATO_INTERVENTION.12.d:0 "In a show of unified strength, senior NATO leaders announced the launch of Operation Aegean Shield. The leaders stated the communist advance threatens to overthrow the legitimate government in Greece and put many innocents at risk of reprisals. To counter this, Operation Aegean Shield will see NATO forces intervene in a peaceful intervention to facilitate the peaceful transfer of Greek officials, military personnel, and civilians most at risk. NATO assets are already moving into position. The officials added that any Greek communist aggression against NATO will be dealt with harshly. The Soviet Union and Greek communist KKE have not responded yet."
 NATO_INTERVENTION.13.d:0 "The KKE, our allies in Greece have asked for guidance with regards to the launch of Operation Aegean Shield by NATO. The Western imperialists assure all parties they intend only to evacuate what they term to be at-risk Greeks to the Aegean islands, which will be under their protection. The KKE certainly lacks the military, especially naval capabilities to stop NATO from its objective. However, the KKE could press its forces or deploy some covert operations to block evacuation routes and potentially prevent NATO from achieving its objectives. However, such a move could end up legitimizing the capitalist propaganda, instead it might be better to let the world see how the imperialists will stop at nothing to protect their puppets."
 NATO_INTERVENTION.14.d:0 "During a press conference, the NATO military spokesman could scarcely hide his satisfaction in declaring the successful completion of Operation Aegean Shield. NATO forces successfully facilitated the evacuation and protection of the former democratic Greek government and military assets to their islands in the Aegean. The Greek communists did not hinder the operation and NATO personnel ended up evacuating far more people than anticipated as many Greeks sought to escape before the communists arrive. The operation also resulted in striking images showing Greeks desperately seeking an escape from communism, giving the alliance a public relations boost. The Soviet Union released its own statement condemning NATO for its unjust intervention." 
 NATO_INTERVENTION.15.d:0 "The beleaguered NATO commander of Operation Aegean Shield admitted the mission had not achieved its objectives. The Western military alliance launched the operation to facilitate the establishment of a free Greek government on the Greek islands to prevent a total communist victory. However, communist saboteurs and agents successfully halted efforts at evacuating key government and military personnel. Communist infiltrators also joined in the evacuation and successfully launched protests on some islands demanding NATO allow them to join the communist government. Many NATO commanders grumbled that operational parameters were too limiting and believed the alliance should only have intervened if they had full freedom to deal with the communists. There are already plans to establish a committee to investigate why the operation has failed."
 NATO_INTERVENTION.16.d:0 "The NATO led operation Aegean Shield has largely succeeded in establishing a free Greek government on the Greek islands. However, there are concerns that the Greek communists will seek to take these islands back, whether overtly, clandestinely, or through propaganda. A senior Greek official and some NATO ambassadors have floated the idea that we relinquish our administration of Cyprus to the free Greek government. This could give them much greater legitimacy, access to a larger population, and a safe base from which to plan the liberation of Greece. Our own officials are not as convinced as many feel British rule in Cyprus is a force of stability for the region and strategically vital to the United Kingdom. The Cypriote Turks would be opposed and any handover must come with a guarantee for their rights. The Prime Minister and cabinet must decide whether to hand over Cyprus or keep the island."
 NATO_INTERVENTION.17.d:0 "Our Foreign Minister confirms reports that the British are strongly considering the handover of Cyprus to the free Greek government established by NATO on the Greek islands. This is of major concern as our people remain rightly concerned over the Turkish Cypriot people. Turkish Cypriot leaders have also reached out to express their fear of a potential Greek takeover. We should strongly consider sending a high-level team to London to present our deep concerns over the plan. This appears the best move to make, however, there are some who feel we should not involve ourselves and hope the United Kingdom handles the situation with tact."
 NATO_INTERVENTION.18.d:0 "A high-level Turkish delegation recently arrived for talks. The only topic of concern is the Cyprus situation. The Turks are strongly opposed to our discussions of ceding the island to the free Greek government. They feel the Cypriot Turks would become marginalized and the resulting backlash among Turks could dramatically hurt Turkish support for NATO. A possibly acceptable situation for Turkey could be if we only ceded the western half of the island but maintained a presence in the east. They have also "offered" to take over the administration of the eastern half if needed. We can either address the Turkish concerns and only cede parts of the island or stick with our initial decision and cede the whole island. Some in the Foreign Office believe the Turkish government is exaggerating the consequence of ceding all of Cyprus."
 NATO_INTERVENTION.19.d:0 "The British government announced certain Greek majority areas of Cyprus will be handed over to the Aegean islands based free Greek government. Respecting the wishes of Cypriote Greeks was cited as the principal motivation for the decision. However, the government noted it was still obligated to the Cypriote Turkish population and as such, Britain will retain control over the eastern part of the island and that community. The news will provide a major boost for the recently defeated Greek government. The communist Greek authorities condemned the announcement as imperial horse trading."
 NATO_INTERVENTION.20.d:0 "In a joint ceremony, British officials in Cyprus officially handed authority to the free Greek government. The island returns to Greek rule after centuries of Ottoman and British rule. Notable Cypriote Greeks were in attendance and reporters on the ground indicate there is a general sense of enthusiasm among the Cypriote Greeks. However, the mood among the large Cypriote Turkish minority is notably dour. Many of their leaders chose not to attend the ceremony and there are anti-British protests currently taking place in Turkey. This despite the Greek government agreeing to British terms protecting the rights and status of Cypriote Turks. Although the Greek government will enjoy a great boost in terms of its strategic position and political legitimacy, it will eventually have to resolve issues on the island before it can consider plans to deal with the mainland communist Greek regime."
 NATO_INTERVENTION.21.d:0 "Cyprus has been handed over to the people of Greece, after centuries of foreign occupation. The British gave us the island on the condition we guarantee the rights of Cypriote Turks. There are already reports from Cyprus of our people flying flags and celebrating the news. We are to immediately dispatch government and military officials to oversee the transfer of authority. It is vital we do not cause any problems on the island and move quick to establish it as a major cornerstone for the liberation of mainland Greece. Our enemies are loudly condemning the news and no doubt suppressing it, as we are quickly establishing ourselves and unifying all the Greek peoples."
 NATO_INTERVENTION.22.d:0 "The British government, in a carefully worded message, stated it would not cede Cyprus to the democratic Greek government. The British argued the precarious security environment on the island and the need to secure a strong presence in the eastern Mediterranean were of paramount importance and cannot be compromised. Despite the disappointing news, the British also stated it would continue to support our struggle and looks forward to deepening relations and expanding areas of cooperation. This marks a huge blow as Cyprus would have given us greater legitimacy and a strong base from which to plan our eventual liberation of mainland Greece from the communists. We can only hope, in time, that the Cypriote Greeks will eventually rally to our cause and the British can reconsider."
