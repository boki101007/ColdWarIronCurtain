 WorldAST.1.desc: "Miners of the Australian working class have erupted into a strike, halting the nation into a standstill. Seen as a continuation of the turmoil of the previous year’s railway strike in the state of Queensland, the miners’ struggle for improved wages and long service leave has left them no choice but to apply necessary action.\n\nThis is not without potential outside interference, as the Miners’ Federation has been seen as heavily influenced by the Soviet Union’s Cominform policy. The promotion of a class conflict to promote communist leadership of the working-class struggle against the current ruling government of the ALP.\n\nIn response, union officials have been ordered to hand over union funds to the industrial registrar, and legislation has been passed that made it illegal to give strikers and their families financial support."

 WorldAST.2.desc: "The tumultuous two months of strikes and fights of the miners of Australia has officially ended. The Chifley government saw no other choice but to deploy troops to break the coal strike, through violent and often brutal means to end the crisis. Troops were even deployed to the mines themselves to make do as interim workers, to keep the nation running in a post-war reconstruction phase.\n\nThe decision to authorise these military operations has not been without scrutiny, as the government’s anti-communist resolve has appeared to be insufficient in the minds of many Australians. While seemingly defeated, Communism still remains an influential factor enough within the working class, to where many are considering voting for the Menzies Coalition at the upcoming election.\n\nWhile it remains on whether Chifley made the correct decision remains to be seen, coal begins to flow as normal."

 WorldAST.3.desc: "The Australian Labor Party have won their third-successive election in a row, with Chifley’s victory tally now reaching 2. Even in the wake of the Communist-influenced coal miners’ strike, this was not enough to deter the working-class voters from once again voting in Labor. Even with a reduced majority in the House.\n\nThe post-war years under Chifley have seen a significant climb of new migrants flooding in from war-torn Europe, including Britain. The nation is left to see if he will uphold his promise to end wartime fuel and food rationing.\n\nWhile the Labor government have held strong, questions will now be asked of the still-Leader of the Opposition, Robert Menzies. And how he will manage to maintain his leadership of the party he founded with his principles, if he cannot lead them to an election victory."

Forming the Liberal Party from 14 different parties in 1945, to winning only 26 of 74 seats 3 years prior to now.\n\nAn advocate for free enterprise and staunch anti-communism, Menzies has successfully reconfigured the Coalition against the Chifley ‘socialist measures’, after the former Prime Minister’s intent to nationalise the banks under strict government control has lost support among many key seats. A detailed speech into Chifley’s secret financial dealings to his own personal friends, by a former State Premier, one Jack Lang, has certainly helped Menzies.\n\nThe 8-year Labor government under Chifley and formerly the late John Curtin has ended, the new conservative government reign begins."

 WorldAST.5.desc: "Prime Minister Robert Menzies has successfully led The Coalition to a second-straight election victory, with The Coalition also picking up six seats in the senate, finally giving them majority control in both chambers of parliament.\n\nAs the threat of Communism has risen with many Western nations, Menzies sought to ban the Australian Communist Party through legislation. Surprisingly the Leader of the Opposition, former Prime Minister Ben Chifley, let the bill pass after a redraft, being shut down by the High Court. Months after this failed attempt, Menzies pushed through the Commonwealth Bank Bill, aiming to establish a ‘Commonwealth Bank Board’ that Labor believed would be filled with private banking interests. Failing to pass through the senate, Menzies saw an opportunity to call a Double Dissolution.

This is now the Coalition’s third election victory in a row.\n\nThe complication of an attaché to the Soviet embassy, a spy officer Vladimir Petrov, and his decision to defect from the Soviet Union following their nation’s power structure shifting to a new leader, has led the nation with a storm of publicity. This follows events from 3 years prior, over Menzies’ failed attempt to ban the Australian Communist Party. The ALP’s new party leader, Dr. H.V. Evatt, and his ambitious promises and an impressive resume, have not gained enough seats to topple the Coalition. Menzies successfully lambasted Evatt’s  extravagant spending promises as ‘the deadliest attack on the stability of Australia’.\n\nLabor are now potentially fighting amongst themselves following this election defeat, as the right-wing anti-Communist contingent within the party has seemingly lost faith in Evatt themselves."

Evatt blamed ‘a small minority of members, located particularly in the State of Victoria’ following Labor’s loss in the 1954 election. And the complication of the Petrov Affair in which Evatt defended a union of Communists under the reasoning of ‘civil liberties’, against Menzies’ staunch McCarthyism.

The Groupers, formerly of the ALP, have now founded their own party as the ‘Anti-Communist Labor’ party. While they were unable to win any seats in the House of Representatives, yet still managing a few senate seats, they were able to take key swing seats away from Labor in the process, granting Robert Menzies and The Coalition a fourth election victory as a result. \n\nThe Double Dissolution called by Menzies once more has seen his position in the nation strengthen, and his party leadership unquestionably his own. As he continues to maintain his commitment to a free world rid of Communism, many wonder if this disastrous setback for the ALP will ever help the party recover from their own self-inflicted wounds."

The first election where campaigns were fought using television as a medium for communicating with voters, Prime Minister Robert Menzies found himself as a confident and more effective television performer, compared to his opponents H.V. Evatt and Arthur Calwell. Many pundits contribute this to their re-election victory.\n\nThe breakaway Anti-Communist Labor party have now formed into the Democratic Labor Party, still taking a third of votes in many key once-safe Labor seats away from Labor, guaranteeing the ALP’s defeat in the election.

While this marks the Coalition’s 6th election victory, it was almost too close to call and could have gone either way.\n\nThe razor thin majority was the result of a ‘credit squeeze’ economic decision, ending the illiberal system of import licensing, in a nation where consumer choices were restricted by protectionism, leading to a surge of imports that exceeded all expectations, and which undermined Australia’s balance of payments and reserves of U.S. dollars. The government’s over-correction led to a minor recession, enough to cause many in the nation to worry.\n\nUnder new ALP leader Arthur Calwell, Labor placed the issue of unemployment front and centre.

 WorldAST.35.desc: "An upset has occurred in Australia, with the current Prime Minister Paul Keating re-elected in an ‘unwinnable’ election many believed the ALP would've lost. The Coalition under the leadership of John Hewson has seemingly failed at what some pundits believed should have been their election victory.\n\nIn the wake of high unemployment rates and a recovering economy, Hewson released the Fightback! Package, a 650-page policy document of radical ‘dry’ economic liberal measures. The introduction of a Goods and Services tax of 15% has scared many in Australia over what the GST would be priced against, especially food. The inability of the Coalition, particularly Hewson, to describe the policy to the population after 18 months of campaigning have seen Keating’s highly critical attacks against the GST, winning back many swing voters back to Labor.\n\nHewson’s future leadership may be in doubt, as Keating continues with his One Nation policies."

 WorldAST.36.t: "[GetNewspaperHeader]Joh Re-Elected In 1993 Election"
 WorldAST.36.desc: "The ever polarising and controversial Prime Minister of Australia Joh Bjelke-Petersen has been re-elected. Although losing a sizable portion of the electorate of the middle class, he has ensured, only just, a majority in the House. His decisions to loosen freedoms of the press, prioritising the rural sector over the urban, and push for further gun and state rights, has seen the ALP gain ground under their new leader Paul Keating.\n\nYet, as the economy slowly recovers from the early recession of the decade, Joh finds himself in a tenuous, yet power position. Although he begins to feel his age, as many wonder whether someone else within the new National Party will take his place soon. Rumours also persist that the arch-conservative faction, formerly of the Liberal Party, may rejoin should leadership strengthen or weakened through either side of the unnatural Coalition."

 #MaidenSpeechAST.1.t: "The Bankstown Boy"
 #MaidenSpeechAST.1.desc: "“As this is my first speech in the House of Representatives and the beginning of my first term in this place I desire sincerely to thank the 55,000 electors of the Blaxland electorate in New South Wales for the honour of allowing me to represent them here.\n\nLike one or two honourable members who made their maiden speeches in this House last week, I would like to be able to describe my electorate as a scenic district, as something of beauty, but unfortunately I cannot. The suburbs within the Blaxland electorate would serve as some of the best examples of chaotic development that can be seen. Unsealed roads, gutterless streets, filthy sewers and lack of adequate sanitation are reminders of the shortcomings of government generally in this country.\n\nFamily life is the very basis of our nationhood. In the last couple of years the Government has boasted about the increasing number of women in the work force. Rather than something to be proud of I feel that this is something of which we should be ashamed. The shortsightedness of the Government's policy was borne out by the headlines in this morning's newspapers. How can we have national growth without people? How can we survive without a population? Is it doing anything to put the working wife back in her home? It is not. It engages in a lot of claptrap. It denigrates the Labor Party for its constructive proposals.\n\nAustralia must never again get itself into the position where it contracts to buy a fearfully expensive war plane, sight unseen, very largely on the claims of its manufacturers; that is all too clear now... Australia is now left to repent at leisure.”"

 #WhitlamDismissal.100 .t: "The Dismissal"
 #WhitlamDismissal.100 .desc: ""Now therefore I, Sir John Robert Kerr, the Governor-General of Australia, do by this, my proclamation..."\n\nThe atmosphere was tumultuous. Hordes of ferocious boos from the people attempting to drown the speaker David Smith out. They chanted and chanted. "We Want Gough!" The Secretary to the Governor-General continued as best he could. Even with the media and the crowd scrummed around him, and the giant man staring down his shoulder.\n\n"Dissolve the Senate and the House of Representatives. Given under my Hand and the Great Seal of Australia on..." \n\nThe Coalition were back in-charge again. Fraser held the reins of power, sworn in as caretaker prime minister on the condition that he end the political deadlock and call an immediate double dissolution election. The Coup was complete. Yet the country would not rest in silence.\n\n"By His Excellency's Command, Malcolm Fraser Prime Minister, John R. Kerr, Governor General. God save the Queen!" \n\nDavid Smith, Secretary to the Governor-General, stepped away. Finally freed from his burden. Silence filled the void. The void the tall man now stood upon, with measured steps. He stayed stoic. He stood tall. They people cheered, as he steeled himself. It may be over, at least for now. Yet, to be remembered in Australian history until the end of time, was his composed demeanour, his strategic restraint, and a steady voice in the face of complete injustice. Forever defiant. And never wavered.\n\n"Ladies and gentlemen. Well may we say ‘God save the Queen’...""
