Now, as the People's Liberation Army advances victoriously towards the Greater Southwest, the failure of the Kuomintang reactionaries has become inevitable. Patriotic Yunnan generals Long Yun and Lu Han have crushed Chiang Kai-shek's plan to establish an anti-communist base in Yunnan.

But the Communists, with no experience of landing operations, were helpless against the Taiwanese fortress which Chiang Kai-shek had operated for so long.

At 1:30 am, three PLA regiments boarded wooden boats and successfully landed on the beach.\nHowever, after the landing, the various units were disorganized and did not receive unified command. When the troops landing on the island lost their unified command and did not consolidate their beachhead positions, they still carried out operations in accordance with the established operational direction and penetrated deep into the enemy. By 4:30 on October 25, the Kuomintang launched a counterattack with the help of reinforcements and tanks. In the afternoon, our army suffered heavy casualties, and only the remaining troops joined up at Guning tou and repelled several counterattacks by the Kuomintang army.\nDue to the weather and strafing by the Kuomintang air Force, all our landing ships were destroyed. By the afternoon of October 27, our troops were found and surrounded by the Kuomintang near ShuangRushan Mountain, and our troops fought bloody battles until the afternoon of October 28, until the head of the 246th Regiment Sun Yuxiu was wounded and committed suicide, and the rest were captured."

It is reported that Hu Feng's literary theories are at odds with the current domestic red literary ideology. Although Hu Feng has long been a leading figure in leftist literary theory, his ideas have been repeatedly criticized by Comrade Mao Zedong. The fundamental reason is that Hu Feng opposed the concept of \"art serving politics,\" which Mao Zedong proposed at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art. Despite widespread criticism, Hu Feng persisted in deviating from the national literary line, adhering to his one-sided and abstract theory of subjective fighting spirit, supported by a small group of nearly one hundred people who maintained anti-Marxist literary creation.\n\nHu Feng's theory of subjective fighting spirit, although highly focused on subjectivity and authentic art, has diverged from our country's unique literary ideology. It represents typical Western bourgeois literature, neglecting China's national literary heritage and constitutes an anti-Party and anti-people artistic theory."

In the meeting, he made the comment that \"the pace of agricultural co-operative development should not be too fast and the demand should not be too hasty\", which, in the eyes of the other comrades of the Central Committee, was clearly a right-leaning opportunistic mistake and a forgetfulness of the principles of the Party as a communist. Afterwards, Comrade Mao Zedong and other CPC patriarchs criticised Deng Zichu's erroneous opinions and right-leaning opportunism. \nComrade Mao Zedong had met with Deng Zichu to discuss the number of co-operatives under agricultural co-operation. Mao Zedong proposed to \"double\" the number of co-operatives but Deng Zichu still insisted on the original plan of \"halving\" the number of co-operatives. After the fruitless discussion, Mao Zedong pointed out in his report on the Problem of Agricultural Co-operativisation that Deng Zichu \"walked like a small-footed woman, committing the right-leaning error of solidification of the mind\"."

However, it is annoying that the quality of these supplies varies, and there is no lack of counterfeit and shoddy products among them. In order to earn high profits, the unscrupulous traders in charge of the frontline supplies went so far as to falsify canned food to supplement the nutrition of the soldiers, and cut corners on medicines and bandages to treat injuries and illnesses as well as warm clothing, which led to the untimely deaths of many volunteer soldiers due to malnutrition or infected diseases. At the same time, the country has begun to organise the Three Anti-corruption Campaign, which has uncovered a large number of corrupt bureaucrats colluding with the capitalists, and perhaps we need to make some timely adjustments to the solidarity with the national bourgeoisie."

In his speech, he expounded on the theory of correctly handling internal contradictions among the people, emphasizing that this should be the central theme of the country's political life.

For Mao Zedong, bringing down the party meant knocking the workers and peasants down again, which he could not tolerate. His trust in intellectuals was exchanged for the betrayal of so-called senior intellectuals, which made him reflect.\nMao Zedong began to conceive an article entitled \"Things Are Changing\". In the article, Mao Zedong believed that some rightists took advantage of the Communist Party's opening of the door to rectification and launched a massive attack on the Communist Party. And for the first time, he raised the issue of the rampant attack of the rightists, with the aim of preparing the party ideologically for the counterattack against the rightist attack. Mao Zedong soon drafted the \"Instructions on Intensifying the Rectification Movement\", pointing out that it is necessary to win over the middle, unite the left, seize the opportunity to mobilize the masses to fight back against the rightists, and win a large-scale victory in the ideological and political fields."

They believed that there were certain rightist errors within the Double Hundred Movement and that there was a risk of these errors developing into a more serious trend. Chen Qitong was one such Party member who held this view. Consequently, Chen Qitong, along with others who shared his concerns, wrote \"Our Opinions on the Current Literary and Artistic Work,\" which was published in the People's Daily in January 1957, with the intention of halting the \"letting a hundred flowers bloom, a hundred schools of thought contend\" policy.\n\nHowever, Chen Qitong's opposition to the Double Hundred Policy due to some of the difficulties it presented was not endorsed by Mao Zedong and was criticized in an editorial in the People's Daily on April 14.

Gao wanted the Chairman to note that this serious rightist opportunist error of Liu was not accidental but had historical roots, and that an error like his in such a high position of leadership would cause great damage to our socialist cause, even though the Chairman had already criticized Liu's error.\nBut Mao did not take heed of Gao's revelation.

It has also issued complementary tasks such as afforestation, pest control, advocating family planning, and strengthening educational efforts. Concerning the improvement of grain production, a comprehensive plan for various agricultural development measures has been systematically outlined. This includes the promotion of high-quality seeds, expanding the sown area, improving agricultural tools, and enhancing water conservation facilities. Simultaneously, emphasis has been placed on the necessity of countering conservative sentiments and boosting the proactive attitude of farmers. The development outline emphasizes the need to tap into the production potential in rural areas to achieve the set targets."
