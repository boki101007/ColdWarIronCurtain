The Kuomintang government, favoring policies of centralization and sinicization, has already taken various measures to align the Taiwanese province into the Chinese state. Taiwanese schools now emphasize Chinese language, history and a curriculum supporting the ideology of the Kuomintang. However, considering that the majority of the Taiwanese people have been disconnected from Chinas influence for over five decades, it is clear that they are not willing to adopt every doctrine laid out by a mainlander-dominated government.\n\n§RIf this modifier falls below -30% Stability and War Support the Kuomintang government will fall and the Republic of China will cease to exist.§! §!"

But following the defeat of the Beiyang clique, the party only focused on maintaining and expanding its power and fighting the Communist Party. Inefficient bureaucrats, corruption, factionalism and opportunism contributed to the downfall of the Kuomintang and its defeat against the Communist Party on the mainland.

The Premier is appointed by the President of the Republic and is responsible for the recommendation of the vice premier, ministers of the government as well as chairmen of the Executive Yuan, which are then to be appointed by the President. The Premier has the duty of the representation of administrative policies and has to report proposed legislation to the Legislative Yuan. The Premier may serve as the Vice President, should the current Vice President take office as the President until the rest of the original presidential term is served. The Premier has to resign from office if a motion of no-confidence is initiated by the Legislative Yuan and approved with a simple majority. Given the enormous influence of Chiang Kai-shek's presidential position, it is unlikely that the Premier will hold any significant powers in the government as of now."

The Vice President also serves as the representative of the President if he is unable to attend office. If the Vice President assumes the presidency in case of the death, illness or resignation of the current President, the head of the Executive Yuan and Prime Minister of the Republic of China will fill the role of Vice President. The office, alongside with the presidential office, is given by the National Assembly every 6 years but holds very little formal power in the Republican government and heavily depends on the policy-agenda of the President§g."

In January 1949, after Chiang Kai-Shek resigned as the president, Li Zongren became the acting president of China, however he never held any significant power and was removed from office after Chiang Kai-shek resumed his duties following the KMT Victory in the Chinese Civil War.§!\n\n§CClique Explanation:§!\n\n§gThe New Guangxi clique, led by Li Zongren, Huang Shaohong, and Bai Chongxi, is one of the most influential warlord cliques in China and has always had a rocky relationship with the central government in Nanjing. Chiang Kai-Shek attempted numerous times to reorganize the warlord armies of Guangxi, which ultimately caused the Guangxi Clique to break off relations with the central government which started the confrontation that lead to the Central Plains War. From 1930 to 1936, the Clique organized the reconstruction of Guangxi, which became a "model" province with a progressive administration. As a result, Guangxi was able to supply large numbers of troops in the war effort against Japan in the Second Sino-Japanese War, giving it great status among the Southern Chinese Provinces.§!"

However there are still obstacles on his journey to strengthen the Kuomintangs rule over all of China. Warlords and various other political cliques rule over major parts of China which could pose a serious threat to the National Leadership in Nanjing. Chiang has expressed his desire to reform the Kuomintang various times throughout the years, and with peace and civil order slowly returning to China he might be able to achieve his goals.§!\n\n§CClique Explanation:§!\n\n§gAfter the defeat of the Beiyang Cliques in Zhili and Nanjing, the Kuomintang relocated its headquarters to Nanjing, declaring it the new capital of the Republic. Over time the Kuomintang secured their authority in the provinces of Central China. The government in Nanjing is the dominant political institution in those provinces and has effectively sidelined any other political rivials, whether they are former local warlords or opposed political cliques. Centralisation has lead to less corruption and more efficient governance in those regions and are considered the "core territory" of the Kuomintang regime, with the KMT seeking to expand their influence in the other regions of China as well.§!"

Under Long, Sun took an anti-communist approach and lead his armies against the escaping Communist forces during the Long March which gave the General praise in the Clique. During the War with Japan, Sun led his troops to Jiangxi Province to fight the Japanese army. At the late stages of the war with Japan, Sun broke away from Long Yun who was later replaced by Lu Han and joined Chiang Kai-shek's forces. During the Chinese Civil War, Lu Han and other generals defected and Sun was one of few who chosen not to defect but to remain loyal to the Republic. As the civil war ended, Sun was appointed governor of his native province. Although his loyalties to Nanking maybe questioned as he has shown to only care for his province similarly to how previous warlords ruled Yunnan.§!"

 POLITICS_YAN_XISHAN_WARLORD_50s_DESC:0 "§gBorn in Shanxi Province in 1883, Yan Xishan he began studying Confucian classics at a young age and eventually joined the Taiyuan military academy in Shanxi. Yan, alongside various other young promising talents, was sent to study in Tokyo where he was fascinated by the Japanese westernisation efforts, believing that China needs to take similar steps to not fall behind on the international stage. After the outbreak of the Xinhai Revolution, he returned to China and joined the fight against the Qing and eventually consolidated his power as Governor of Shanxi following the death of Yuan Shikai. During World War Two, he served as commander in Shanxi against the Japanese but has secretly intensified his operations against the local communist movement. After fulfilling a mediation role as Prime Minister during the civil war, Yan has returned to his governor position in Shanxi.§!\n\n§CClique Explanation:§!\n\n§gShanxi split from the Beiyang Army after the Xinhai Revolution under the leadership of Yan Xishan and has taken a neutral stance to avoid involvement in military conflicts. Shanxi saw great improvement in education, welfare and healthcare in the 1920s until Yan decided to join the KMT in their crusade against the Fengtian Clique in 1927. During the Japanese occupation, the Shanxi clique was heavily weakened resulting in the brief Communist occupation from 1946 until 1949. With the Kuomintang back in power it is safe to assume that Nanjing is seeking to integrate the former autonomous clique into the Republic properly.§!"

Ma sided with Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang after the succesful Northern Expedition. Ma's fierce anti-communist stance and loyalty to the Kuomintang have been proven multiple times, as shown in his military operations against the Communists in the early 1930s and the refusal of multiple Japanese defection offers. His unconditional loyalty to the Kuomintang, despite being Hui, has made him one of Chiang Kai-sheks personal trustworthies. In 1945, Bufang was appointed to the central committee of the Kuomintang party, and he successfully fought against revolting Uyghurs in addition to fighting the Communist Party of China during the Chinese Civil War.§!\n\n§CClique Explanation:§!\n\n§gThe Ma Families have been ruling Northwestern China ever since the abolition of the Qing Dynasty.

The most prominent members of the families include Ma Bufang, the current representative of the Ma Clique, cavalry general Ma Hongkui, Ma Buqing, Ma Hushan and Ma Hongbin. Past attempts to destabilize the region by Chiang Kai-Shek have failed and the relative absence of Japanese and Communist troops in the Northwest has allowed the region to keep its autonomy from Nanjing.§!"

After February 1949, Sun was appointed deputy commanding officer of the Chongqing pacification HQ and commanding officer of Chuandong pacification HQ. After the fall of Liu Wenhui, he was picked by the Generalissimo as military governor of Sichuan.§!\n\n§CClique Explanation:§!\n\n§gAfter the fall of the Qing Dynasty, the region of Sichuan turned into contested territory, with numerous warlords fighting for control over the province for decades. The Sichuan Clique was divided into smaller warlord groups, or Defense Zones, separated from each other with distinct military, political, and economic boundaries. In 1935, Liu Xiang consolidated his rule in Chongqing but eventually died only 3 years later. This opened the door for the Central Government, who was relocated to Chongqing at that point, to further integrate the province into the Republic. However, the end of the Anti-Japanese War and the resumption of the Chinese Civil War caused successor Liu Wenhui to regain a certain degree of autonomy, which is still being upheld in Sichuan, even after Liu Wenhuis arrest.§!"

However, they met strong resistance within the CPC from members such as Zhang Guotao and Zhou Enlai. Not surprisingly, they were assigned insignificant positions. During the 1930s, he became one of Mao Zedongs main political rivals within the CPC, embracing traditional marxist-leninist ideology in contrast to the beliefs of Mao. In 1937, he persuaded Mao to ally with Chiang Kai-shek in the face of Japanese aggression. During the war he continued to criticise Maos policy towards Japand and the Kuomintang.
